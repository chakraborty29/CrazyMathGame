Math Game for APCS P Class
As of right now the high score doesn't work, the sound is not playing and that is driving me crazy and I'm trying to make it when the game is finished it goes back to the first ViewController

**I know the design is bad ...  I am really bad with it I don't know where to even start when it comes to designing. Some of the images are from: https://learnappmaking.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode/ because I was trying to make the game the person in that link was trying to make but without any help just my own knowledge and I decided not to cause I had a lot of trouble with it and kept his images because I didn't want to make new images.**

This is the title page and I'm trying to make it so that when you restart the game it can go back to this View Controller. I am also trying to make it that you can see your highest score. This is just the initial but I want to do so much more with it.

This is the game page, the number are buttons and the question place is Label. The **B..n** I made for testing purposes.

**Things I want to implement:**
- Arcade mode where the user keeps on answering questions untill they get something wrong.
- The original game that I have rn and set it up as practice mode where the user can choose how long the timer they want to be and how many questions right to win and stuff like that.
- For both practice and arcade I want to enable difficulty level like easy and then medium and then hard. I honestly don't know how I'm going to implement this but I will be doing my course and if you seem to come accross this project I hope you can prove some help and support.


**THANK YOU FOR VIEWING THIS PROJECT, IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR TIPS ABOUT ANYTHING, LEAVE THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION SO I CAN LEARN FROM YOU GUYS AND BECOME A BETTER PROGRAMMER. I AM A BEGINNER IN SWIFT AND XCODE AND I JUST KNOW BASIC APCS P STUFF LIKE VARIABLES, CONSTATNS AND FUNCTIONS AND I'M JUST USING THOSE TO IMPLEMENT THIS GAME.**
